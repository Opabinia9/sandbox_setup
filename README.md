Hello All, this is a script and files i use to setup my sandboxes that i use for holberton school australia
right now it's setup so i can just enter the line bellow and it gets all my repos and usernames
HOWEVER, i do plan on creating a secondary script that works for other people, so they just provide there names and repos a arguments
also, feel free to fork this and make your own, set for your own prefrences and specific needs
enjoy

oneliner for me
